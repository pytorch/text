# Overview
# --------
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to use a pre-trained T5 Model for text summarization on the CNN-DailyMail dataset.
# We will demonstrate how to use the torchtext library to:
#
# 1. Build a text pre-processing pipeline for a T5 model
# 2. Read in the CNNDM dataset and pre-process the text
# 3. Instantiate a pre-trained T5 model with base configuration, and perform text summarization on input text
#

#######################################################################
# Data Transformation
# -------------------
#
# The T5 model does not work with raw text. Instead, it requires the text to be transformed into numerical form
# in order to perform training and inference. The following transformations are required for the T5 model:
#
# 1. Tokenize text
# 2. Convert tokens into (integer) IDs
# 3. Truncate the sequences to a specified maximum length
# 4. Add end-of-sequence (EOS) and padding token IDs
#
# T5 uses a SentencePiece model for text tokenization. Below, we use a pre-trained SentencePiece model to build
# the text pre-processing pipeline using torchtext's T5Transform. Note that the transform supports both
# batched and non-batched text input (i.e. one can either pass a single sentence or a list of sentences), however
# the T5 model expects the input to be batched.

# Dataset
# -------
# torchtext provides several standard NLP datasets. For a complete list, refer to the documentation at https://pytorch.org/text/stable/datasets.html.
# These datasets are built using composable torchdata datapipes and hence support standard flow-control and mapping/transformation
# using user defined functions and transforms. Below, we demonstrate how to pre-process the CNNDM dataset to include the prefix necessary
# for the model to identify the task it is performing.
#
# The CNNDM dataset has a train, validation, and test split. Below we demo on the test split.
#
# .. note::
#       Using datapipes is still currently subject to a few caveats. If you wish
#       to extend this example to include shuffling, multi-processing, or
#       distributed learning, please see :ref:`this note <datapipes_warnings>`
#       for further instructions.

# Sequence Generator
# ------------------
#
# We can define a sequence generator to produce an output sequence based on the input sequence provided. This calls on the
# model's encoder and decoder, and iteratively expands the decoded sequences until the end-of-sequence token is generated
# for all sequences in the batch. The `greedy_generator` method shown below uses a greedy search (i.e. expands the sequence
# based on the most probable next word).

# Output
# ------
#
# ::
#
#    Example 1:
#
#    prediction: the Palestinians officially become the 123rd member of the international
#    criminal court . the move gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed
#    in the occupied Palestinian territory . the ICC opened a preliminary examination into
#    the situation in the occupied territories .
#
#    target: Membership gives the ICC jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in
#    Palestinian territories since last June . Israel and the United States opposed the
#    move, which could open the door to war crimes investigations against Israelis .
#
#
#    Example 2:
#
#    prediction: a stray pooch in Washington state has used up at least three of her own
#   after being hit by a car . the dog staggers to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and
#    emaciated, where she is found . she suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a
#    caved-in sinus cavity .
#
#    target: Theia, a bully breed mix, was apparently hit by a car, whacked with a hammer
#    and buried in a field . "She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life," says
#    Sara Mellado, who is looking for a home for Theia .
#
#
#    Example 3:
#
#    prediction: mohammad Javad Zarif is the foreign minister of the country . he has been
#    a key figure in securing a breakthrough in nuclear talks . he has been a hero in the
#    international community .
#
#    target: Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other
#    foreign minister . He once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San
#    Francisco . The Iranian foreign minister tweets in English .
#
#
#    Example 4:
#
#    prediction: five americans were monitored for three weeks after being exposed to
#    Ebola . one of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged .
#    none of the patients developed the deadly virus .
#
#    target: 17 Americans were exposed to the Ebola virus while in Sierra Leone in March .
#    Another person was diagnosed with the disease and taken to hospital in Maryland .
#    National Institutes of Health says the patient is in fair condition after weeks of
#    treatment .
#
#
#    Example 5:
#
#    prediction: the student was identified during an investigation by campus police and
#    the office of student affairs . he admitted to placing the noose on the tree early
#    Wednesday morning .
#
#    target: Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary
#    review . School officials identified student during investigation and the person
#    admitted to hanging the noose, Duke says . The noose, made of rope, was discovered on
#    campus about 2 a.m.
