    description: |
      Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

      If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the code. It is very important for he snippet to be as succinct (minimal) as possible, so please take time to trim down any irrelevant code to help us debug efficiently. We are going to copy-paste your code and we expect to get the same result as you did: avoid any external data, and include the relevant imports, etc. For example:

      ```python
      # All necessary imports at the beginning
      import torch
      import torchvision
      from torchvision.ops import nms

      # A succinct reproducing example trimmed down to the essential parts:
      N = 5
      boxes = torch.rand(N, 4)  # Note: the bug is here, we should enforce that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2!
      scores = torch.rand(N)
      nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold=.9)
      ```

      If the code is too long (hopefully, it isn't), feel free to put it in a public gist and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com.

      Please also paste or describe the results you observe instead of the expected results. If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the **full** traceback of the exception. It may be relevant to wrap error messages in ```` ```triple quotes blocks``` ````.
